#TiRadioCheck
#####A Cross-platform RadioButton and CheckBox in Titanium
I have added CheckBox and other useful bits on top of [yozef/TiRadioButtonGroup](https://github.com/yozef/TiRadioButtonGroup).

## WHAT'S NEW??
* CheckBox option added

* Added option to hide/show the Labels

* Now you can have Preselected items

* You can also throw some Disabled items (CheckBox only)

* And you get results as an nice array of Labels

### How the hell do I use it?
* Place the ```checkRadio.js``` file into ```/apps/lib/``` folder in Alloy project or ```/resources/lib/``` folder in Classic project.
* Place the all ```*.png``` files from `/images/` to `/app/assets/images/` in Alloy project or `/Resources/images/` folder in Classic project. *(Create the `images` folder if it is not there.)*
* Check index.js for more details.
